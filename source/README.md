# React demo project

React Demo Project
This is a simple React application featuring:
-  Home Page – Displays a list of products
-  Login Page – User authentication via form
-  Product Details Page – Shows detailed info for each product

 Authentication
- Users must log in to access the Home page.
- Login form requires:
- First Name
- Last Name
- Phone Number
(All fields are mandatory)
- Logged-in user data (name) is stored in localStorage.

 Protected Routes
- The app uses a ProtectedRoute component to restrict access to authenticated users.
- If a user is not logged in, they are redirected to the Login page.

 React Hooks Used
- useState – for managing component state
- useEffect – for side effects like fetching or syncing data
- useContext – for sharing product data across components
